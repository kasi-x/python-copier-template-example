# Run in a container

Pre-built containers with python-copier-template-example and its dependencies already
installed are available on [Github Container Registry](https://ghcr.io/kasi-x/python-copier-template-example).

## Starting the container

Pre-built images are published to the container registry on every release.
To pull the container from github container registry and run:

```
$ docker run ghcr.io/kasi-x/python-copier-template-example:latest --version
```

To get a released version, use a numbered release instead of `latest`.



## Logging in the cloud

Logs go to stderr as human-readable console text by default; set the
`LOG_FORMAT=json` environment variable to switch to one-JSON-object-per-line
instead, which log aggregators (CloudWatch Logs, Cloud Logging, Azure
Monitor, journald, ...) can parse. This is independent of which (if any)
cloud SDK dependencies were added, and of which platform runs the
container — the same image works locally (console) and in any cloud
(JSON), so there's nothing extra to build per target: just set the
environment variable wherever the container runs.

[Render](https://render.com/docs/logging), [Railway](https://docs.railway.com/guides/structured-logging-production)
and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/kb/guide/add-structured-application-logs-to-vercel-functions)
all colour-code and filter by severity in their log viewer if the JSON has a
`level` + `message` field pair; `logging_setup.py`'s JSON mode already uses
`level` but names the message field `event` (structlog's own convention), so
those three won't pick up severity colouring out of the box. If that
matters to you, swap `"event"` for `"message"` in `logging_setup.py` — logs
are fully readable either way, this only affects that colouring/filtering.
