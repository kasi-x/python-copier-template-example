# Contribute to the project

Contributions and issues are most welcome! All issues and pull requests are
handled through [GitHub](https://github.com/kasi-x/python-copier-template-example/issues). Also, please check for any existing issues before
filing a new one. If you have a great idea but it involves big changes, please
file a ticket before making a pull request! We want to make sure you don't spend
your time coding something that might not fit the scope of the project.

## Security

Please do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities. Report them
privately via the [Security Advisory workflow](https://github.com/kasi-x/python-copier-template-example/security/advisories/new) — see [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) for details.

## Issue or Discussion?

Github also offers [discussions](https://github.com/kasi-x/python-copier-template-example/discussions) as a place to ask questions and share ideas. If
your issue is open ended and it is not obvious when it can be "closed", please
raise it as a discussion instead.

## Setting up a development environment

It is recommended that developers use a [vscode devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers). This repository contains configuration to set up a containerized development environment that suits its own needs. Outside a container, the README's installation section has the exact commands for this project.

## Common commands

The `task` task runner drives the common commands:

```sh
task fix            # auto-fix formatting and lint
task lint           # ruff format --check + ruff check (check-only)
task test           # pytest
task type-check     # type checker + static analysis
task check          # everything above
```

Run `task fix` before committing to apply formatting and lint
fixes, then `task check` before finishing a change. The
repo-hygiene checks (secrets, workflow linting, YAML validity, conventional
commit messages) run in CI, not as local hooks — the fix and check commands
work anywhere, including outside a git repository.

## Code Coverage

While 100% code coverage does not make a library bug-free, it significantly
reduces the number of easily caught bugs! Please make sure coverage remains the
same or is improved by a pull request!

## Commits and CI

- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
  (`feat:`, `fix:`, ...); the repository's hygiene CI enforces it on commit
  messages and the PR title.
- CI runs lint, type-check, and tests on every push plus a docs
  build; keep all of them green.

This project was created using the
[python-copier-template](https://github.com/kasi-x/python-copier-template) for
Python projects. Its documentation lives at
